# Supply Chain Analysis Using Python

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a **Supply Chain dataset** to gain insights into sales, revenue, and product trends. The main objective is to understand how pricing, product categories, and other factors impact overall revenue and business performance.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about:
- Product types
- Sales and revenue
- Pricing
- Customer data (if any)
- Other supply chain related metrics

*Dataset used:* `supply_chain_data.csv`

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **NumPy** – for numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – for data visualization

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Loading:** Import CSV dataset using Pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, duplicates, and correct data types.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Sales and revenue trends
   - Product category performance
   - Price vs revenue analysis
4. **Visualizations:**
   - Bar charts, line plots, and scatter plots for insights
   - Heatmaps for correlation analysis
5. **Insights & Recommendations:** Key findings from the analysis for improving supply chain efficiency.

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `supply-chain-analysis.ipynb`
2. Make sure all required libraries are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
